### hey, welcome 👋

i'm krunal — a data analyst based in **boston, ma**, studying at **northeastern university**.

i spend most of my time writing sql, building pipelines, and trying to make messy data actually usable. i've interned as an ml engineer, built cloud-based data platforms, and made dashboards that people *actually* look at (rare, i know).

i don't call myself a "data enthusiast" or a "passionate lifelong learner." i just like solving problems with data, and i'm getting better at it every day.

**currently looking for:** data analyst / analytics engineer / junior data engineer roles

**industries i'm drawn to:** healthcare, public sector, sports analytics, fintech

---

### what i work with

i'm not listing every tool i've ever touched. these are the ones i actually use and feel confident in:

**daily drivers** → `Python` · `SQL` · `dbt` · `Pandas` · `Jupyter`

**cloud stuff** → `GCP` · `BigQuery` · `Cloud Run` · `GCS` · `Docker`

**viz** → `Tableau` · `Power BI` · `Streamlit`

**ml (when it makes sense)** → `Scikit-Learn` · `TensorFlow` · `Keras`

**databases** → `MySQL` · `PostgreSQL` · `MongoDB`

**basics that matter** → `Git` · `Excel` (yes, really)

---

### stuff i've actually built

**NYC 311 Data Platform** — automated ingestion from NYC Open Data APIs → bronze/silver/gold layers in dbt → analytics-ready tables in BigQuery. real pipeline, not a tutorial copy-paste.

**Chelsea Street Bridge Lift Prediction** — worked with MassDOT to predict bridge lifts using weather + vessel + historical data. built tableau dashboards for commuter route planning. one of the most interesting projects i've done.

**Bitcoin Price Predictor** — random forest model + streamlit app. nothing groundbreaking, but a solid end-to-end ml project: data → model → deployed dashboard.

**ML Internship @ METY Technology** — feature engineering, model evaluation, working with real stakeholders. learned more here about how ml works in practice than in any course.

### a bit more about me

- i moved from india to the US for grad school and it was the best decision i've made
- i believe the best data work is invisible — people just see better decisions
- i'm not great at front-end stuff (this readme took me way too long)
- i think `dbt test` is underrated and every data team should use it
- i once spent 4 hours debugging a query that was missing a single comma
